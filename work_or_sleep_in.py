#Prompt the user for a day of the week just like the previous problem. But this time, print "Go to work" if it's a work day and "Sleep in" if it's a weekend day. Example session:

if day == 1:
    print("Go to work")
elif day == 2:
    print("Go to work")
elif day == 3:

elif day == 5:

elif day == 6:
    print("Sleep in")
elif day == 0:
